<h1>Please Don’t Just Say Hello In Chat</h1>
<p>Modern chat communication should be done in a way that saves time for all participants and enables an efficient, asynchronous exchange of information. Don’t expect an answer if you just write “Hello” in chat. Don’t call someone out of the blue.</p>
<p>Instead, phrase a message that allows your chat partners to provide a meaningful response as soon as they allocate time to read and answer your message.</p>
