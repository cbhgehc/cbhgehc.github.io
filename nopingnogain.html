<h4><strong>Chat Messages</strong></h4>
<p>Avoid opening a direct chat with and type "Hello".</p>
<h4><span class="coh-style-heading-3">Minimize the use of meetings</span></h4>
<p><span class="coh-style-heading-3">Meetings aren&rsquo;t very efficient because they pull employees away from their regular duties.&nbsp;<strong>Before scheduling a meeting, consider whether it is necessary.</strong>&nbsp;Could the goal be achieved by sharing the information via a group chat that participants could attend at any time?</span></p>
<h4><strong>Online Meetings</strong></h4>
<p>If the meeting is required, make an agenda, and distribute it to all participants in advance. Be sure to stick to it. Keep the meeting brief (less than one hour) to allow attendees to decompress afterward.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span class="coh-style-heading-3">Lead by example</span></h4>
<p><span class="coh-style-heading-3"><strong>Managers and executives must adopt good communication strategies and continue to use them</strong>. Only then will employees do the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="coh-style-heading-3">Effective communication in an enterprise company isn&rsquo;t something that is achieved overnight. It takes time and commitment on the part of everyone who works there if it is going to work. The effort is definitely worthwhile since the company will reap the benefit of happier, more efficient employees who can communicate more clearly and work together more effectively.</span></p>
